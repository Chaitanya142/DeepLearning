# 📊 Loan Default Risk Analytics Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🔍 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** framework applied to a consumer finance dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns and key variables that influence loan default behavior, enabling smarter lending decisions and enhanced risk management.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Loan providers often struggle to assess applicants with limited or no credit history, increasing the risk of defaults and financial losses. This project aims to:
- Detect applicants likely to default
- Avoid rejecting reliable borrowers
- Minimize losses from risky approvals

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Identify variables that signal payment difficulties
- Segment clients based on repayment behavior
- Support decisions like loan denial, amount adjustment, or interest rate modification
- Strengthen portfolio and risk assessment strategies

## 📂 Dataset Description
The analysis uses three key files:
1. `application_data.csv`: Client details at the time of loan application
2. `previous_application.csv`: Historical loan decisions (Approved, Cancelled, Refused, Unused Offer)
3. `columns_description.csv`: Data dictionary for interpreting variables

## 🛠️ Analysis Workflow
- **Missing Data Handling**: Detect and treat missing values appropriately
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and justify outliers without mandatory removal
- **Data Imbalance Analysis**: Examine imbalance in the target variable (payment difficulties)
- **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**: Explore distributions and relationships between variables
- **Correlation Mapping**: Identify top correlations within segmented data (excluding target variable)

## 📊 Visualization Strategy
- Visualizations created using Python (e.g., histograms, boxplots, bar charts)
- Optional recreation in Tableau for enhanced presentation
- Plots emphasize variable importance in distinguishing defaulters

## 📁 Deliverables
- ✅ One or two annotated Jupyter Notebooks with code, markdown, and visualizations
- ✅ PDF presentation summarizing methodology, findings, and business insights

## 🧾 Notes
- Target variable is categorical and excluded from correlation analysis
- Looping structures recommended for high-dimensional data exploration
- Business interpretation is prioritized throughout the analysis

## 🚀 Impact
This project empowers data-driven decision-making in loan approvals, reduces default risk, and promotes financial sustainability for consumer finance institutions.
