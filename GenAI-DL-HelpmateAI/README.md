# 🧠 Project Options Overview

You are offered two main paths to build an end-to-end AI project using **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex**:

## 🔹 Option 1: Build a RAG System
- **Domain**: Insurance
- **Goal**: Create a generative search system that answers queries from insurance policy documents
- **Tools**: LangChain or LlamaIndex

## 🔹 Option 2: Build Your Own Project (BYOP)
- Design and implement a custom AI project in any domain
- Suggested themes:

### 🔍 Search Systems
- **Email Search AI**: Search and summarize organizational email threads (Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marawanxmamdouh/email-thread-summary-dataset)  
- **Fashion Search AI**: Recommend products based on user queries  (Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/djagatiya/myntra-fashion-product-dataset)
- **Product Recommendation System**: Suggest items based on user preferences  (Can use shop assist ai)

### 🤖 Agent Systems
- **Conversational Agent**: Chatbot that responds contextually  
- **Data Analytics Agent**: Converts natural language queries into data insights  
- **SQL Agent**: Retrieves and analyzes data from databases
